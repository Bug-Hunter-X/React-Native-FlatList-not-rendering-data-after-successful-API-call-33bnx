This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data after a successful API call.  The issue is likely related to how the data is processed or the way the FlatList is configured.  The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The solution, found in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this by ensuring that the data is properly handled and that the FlatList is correctly configured.
